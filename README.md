# SustainabilityProfitCorrelation

Thesis: Our country's gross domesetic product (GDP) is a comprehensive account of our nation's economic status. Business' economic health is interwoven into this measure of GDP, thus accurate predictions of changes in GDP will help in strengthening business decisions and strategies. The increase in usage of renweable energy resources may be a way for a country to stabilize GDP growth to a desirable rate. This analysis explores correlations between GDP growth and renewable energy consumption. A simple univariate multilayer perceptron is built to forecast GDP growth. This provides the basis for building a new multivariate model that uses renewable energy consumption and GDP information to predict GDP growth. The Granger causality test will be applied.  







and the use of renewable energy consumption as a potential driver of positive GDP growth. To investigate this, correlation plots are made for countries in different income categories. Also   





The move towards sustainability has potential to be more profitable than non-sustainable business models; during the transition to sustainable models and in the long term; certainly so in the super long-term. Mainly, by sustainable I mean environmental and social impacts. I posit that the majority of people, who are financially capable to, will be willing to pay a larger up-front cost for sustainably viable items and options when given the choice. Products can be marketed as such. Furthermore, as the global economy moves towards sustainability, return profiles could be positively impacted from actions that are taken now to move towards providing/marketing consumers sustainable options. This project is meaningful from a users perspective, ie. promotion of social/environmental responsibility (excellent for riding the wave post-covid), and from a business perspective, ie. profit driven.

The following plots show exploratory results of a first look at the data.

There is a very slight trend in positive correlation between annual GDP growth rate % and renewable energy consumption, and annual GDP growh rate % and the ratio of female to male labor in the workforce. There are a handful of outliers that show quite strong positive correlations. This hints that promotion and marketing of sustainable (environmental and social) actions may have a positive effect on GDP growth rate. More studies can surely be done to cross reference more data and infer market drivers. I would really love to be able to be part of the data incubator and watch this project flourish! :)
